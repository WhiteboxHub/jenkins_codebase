# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for Docker and Kubernetes Deployment

## Overview

Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline configuration that automates the process of building, tagging, and deploying Docker images to a Kubernetes cluster.

The pipeline integrates GitHub, Docker Hub, and Kubernetes to achieve a fully automated CI/CD process for deploying a front-end application.

## What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery in software development. It automates tasks such as code builds, tests, and deployment to various environments.

### Key Jenkins Features:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically builds and tests your code whenever changes are made.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automates the deployment process, ensuring that code changes are quickly pushed to production.
- **Plugin Support**: Jenkins has a wide range of plugins, enabling integration with various tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, Slack, and more.
- **Pipeline as Code**: Jenkins supports defining build and deployment pipelines as code using `Jenkinsfile`, making it easier to maintain and version control.

## How Jenkins Pipeline Works

A Jenkins pipeline consists of multiple stages, where each stage is responsible for a particular task in the CI/CD process. These tasks include code checkout, building Docker images, pushing those images to Docker Hub, and deploying the image to a Kubernetes cluster.

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Checkout**: Pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Build Docker Image**: Builds a Docker image from the application code.
3. **Tag Docker Image**: Tags the built image with the appropriate version/tag and prepares it for pushing to Docker Hub.
4. **Push Docker Image**: Pushes the tagged Docker image to Docker Hub, making it available for deployment.
5. **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster, updating the Kubernetes deployment with the new image.

## Requirements

To use this Jenkins pipeline, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

### 1. **Jenkins Setup**
- Install Jenkins on a server or use a hosted Jenkins solution.
- Set up Jenkins with the following plugins:
  - **Docker Pipeline Plugin**: For working with Docker images.
  - **Kubernetes CLI Plugin**: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
  - **Git Plugin**: To pull code from GitHub.
  
### 2. **Docker Setup**
- Install **Docker** on the Jenkins server or agent where the pipeline will run.
- Create a Docker Hub account and store Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins.

### 3. **Kubernetes Setup**
- Set up **kubectl** on the Jenkins server to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
- Make sure the Kubernetes cluster is accessible, and you have proper permissions to deploy applications.

### 4. **GitHub Repository**
- A GitHub repository containing your applicationâ€™s code and Dockerfile.
- Ensure the repository is accessible to Jenkins (via SSH or HTTPS).

## Pipeline Breakdown

### **1. Checkout Stage**

In this stage, Jenkins pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.

```groovy
stage('Checkout') {
    steps {
        git url: "${GIT_REPO_URL}"
    }
}
