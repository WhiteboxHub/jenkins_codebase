# Overview of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

CI/CD is a methodology to improve software development speed and reliability.

## Continuous Integration (CI):
- **Definition**: After testing, the code is automatically prepared for deployment.
- **How it works**: Code is deployed to staging after tests pass.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures every update is production-ready.

## Continuous Deployment (CD):
- **Definition**: Extends CI by deploying code directly to production.
- **How it works**: If tests pass, code is deployed to production without manual steps.
- **Why it matters**: Speeds up delivery and bug fixes.

Example: Deploy web apps to AWS using Jenkins pipelines.
